# Issue 4 Implementation Summary: Training Equipment Gallery Admin Controls

## ✅ Completed Implementation

### 1. **Updated Admin Interface (`admin-site-content-manager.tsx`)**
- ✅ Added `equipmentImages: string[]` to SiteContent interface
- ✅ Added default equipment images with current Unsplash URLs  
- ✅ Created "Training Equipment Images" card in Media tab
- ✅ Implemented upload/remove functionality matching Hero Images pattern
- ✅ Added file upload with Supabase Storage integration
- ✅ Added URL input fields for manual entry

### 2. **Updated Server Storage (`storage.ts`)**
- ✅ Added equipment_images field handling in getSiteContent()
- ✅ Added equipment_images field handling in updateSiteContent()  
- ✅ Added default equipment images as fallback values
- ✅ Integrated with existing site_content table structure

### 3. **Updated Home Page (`home.tsx`)**
- ✅ Added site content API query using useQuery
- ✅ Updated equipment gallery to use dynamic `siteContent?.equipmentImages`
- ✅ Maintained fallback to current Unsplash URLs if API fails
- ✅ Preserved existing responsive grid layout

### 4. **Database Migration**
- ✅ Created migration SQL file (`Tests/equipment-images-migration.sql`)
- ✅ Migration manually executed in Supabase SQL Editor
- ✅ Added equipment_images JSONB column with default values

## 🧪 Testing Required

### Admin Panel Testing:
1. Navigate to http://localhost:5173/admin
2. Login with admin credentials (admin@coachwilltumbles.com / TumbleCoach2025!)
3. Go to Site Content → Media tab
4. Verify "Training Equipment Images" section appears
5. Test uploading new equipment images
6. Test URL input fields
7. Test add/remove image functionality
8. Save changes and verify persistence

### Frontend Testing:
1. Navigate to http://localhost:5173 (home page)
2. Scroll to "Our Training Equipment" section
3. Verify images load from site content API
4. Test that changes in admin panel reflect on home page

### API Testing:
```bash
# Test site content API includes equipment images
curl http://localhost:5001/api/site-content | jq '.equipmentImages'

# Should return array of image URLs
```

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### Before (Hard-coded):
- Fixed 6 Unsplash URLs in home.tsx
- No admin controls
- No persistence

### After (Dynamic):
- Equipment images managed through admin panel
- Images stored in Supabase Storage or as URLs
- Changes persist in database
- Home page dynamically loads from API
- Fallback to default images if API fails

## 🔧 Next Steps

1. **Test admin functionality** - Upload and manage equipment images
2. **Verify database persistence** - Ensure changes save correctly
3. **Test frontend display** - Confirm home page shows updated images
4. **Test fallback behavior** - Ensure graceful degradation if API fails

## 📝 Notes

- Migration SQL already executed in Supabase
- All TypeScript compilation passes
- Development server running on correct ports (5173/5001)
- Maintains backward compatibility with fallback images
- Follows existing patterns from Hero Images implementation

The implementation is complete and ready for testing!
