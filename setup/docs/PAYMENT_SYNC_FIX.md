# Payment Sync Fix - Session Paid Status

## Issue
The scheduled payment sync was incorrectly marking bookings as "session-paid" immediately after Stripe checkout completion, before attendance was actually completed. This caused bookings to show as fully paid when only the reservation fee had been collected.

## Solution
Modified the payment flow to ensure proper timing:

### 1. Payment Sync (server/storage.ts)
**Before:** Completed Stripe sessions immediately set `SESSION_PAID` status
```typescript
// OLD - INCORRECT
if (session.payment_status === 'paid') {
  newPaymentStatus = PaymentStatusEnum.SESSION_PAID;
  newStatus = BookingStatusEnum.CONFIRMED;
}
```

**After:** Completed Stripe sessions only set `RESERVATION_PAID` status
```typescript  
// NEW - CORRECT
if (session.payment_status === 'paid') {
  newPaymentStatus = PaymentStatusEnum.RESERVATION_PAID;
  newStatus = BookingStatusEnum.PENDING;
}
```

### 2. Attendance Completion (server/routes.ts)
The attendance endpoint already had correct logic to upgrade `RESERVATION_PAID` to `SESSION_PAID` when attendance is marked as completed:

```typescript
// Synchronize payment status when attendance is marked as completed
if (attendanceStatus === AttendanceStatusEnum.COMPLETED) {
  // Update payment status to "session-paid" if it was previously "reservation-paid"  
  if (booking.paymentStatus === PaymentStatusEnum.RESERVATION_PAID) {
    await storage.updateBookingPaymentStatus(id, PaymentStatusEnum.SESSION_PAID);
    booking.paymentStatus = PaymentStatusEnum.SESSION_PAID;
  }
}
```

## Payment Status Flow

### Correct Flow (After Fix)
1. **Stripe Checkout Complete** → `reservation-paid` + `pending`
2. **Attendance Marked Complete** → `session-paid` + appropriate booking status

### Incorrect Flow (Before Fix) 
1. **Stripe Checkout Complete** → `session-paid` + `confirmed` ❌
2. Attendance completion had no effect on payment status

## Verification

### Integration Test
Created `test-payment-sync.cjs` which verifies:
- ✅ Completed Stripe sessions only set `reservation-paid`
- ✅ `session-paid` is only applied after attendance completion
- ✅ Full payment flow works end-to-end

### Unit Test  
Created `tests/payment-sync-test.js` for comprehensive testing scenarios

## Impact
- **Booking Status**: More accurate payment status tracking
- **Business Logic**: Payment status now correctly reflects actual service delivery
- **Admin Dashboard**: Clearer distinction between reserved vs. completed sessions
- **Financial Reporting**: Proper separation of reservation fees vs. full session payments
