# Safety Information Field Updates

This update addresses the requirement that safety fields in bookings should never be null and adds functionality to allow parents to update pickup and dropoff information in the parent portal.

## Database Schema Changes

1. Updated the schema.ts file to add `.notNull()` constraints to the safety columns:
   - `dropoffPersonName`
   - `dropoffPersonRelationship`
   - `dropoffPersonPhone`
   - `pickupPersonName`
   - `pickupPersonRelationship`
   - `pickupPersonPhone`

2. Created SQL migration script to update existing records:
   - Sets non-null default values for any null safety fields
   - Adds NOT NULL constraints to the safety columns
   - Sets `safety_verification_signed` to true for all existing bookings

## Frontend Changes

1. Added Safety Information Dialog component:
   - Allows parents to update pickup and dropoff information
   - Option to update current bookings with new safety information
   - Form validation to ensure all required fields are filled

2. Updated Parent Dashboard:
   - Added "Pickup/Dropoff Safety Info" button to Account Actions section
   - Integrated SafetyInformationDialog component
   - Display pickup/dropoff information in the UI

3. Updated Booking Modal:
   - Modified form schema to require safety fields
   - Added validation for safety information fields
   - Default values for safety fields based on parent information

## Backend Changes

1. Updated booking creation to ensure safety fields are never null:
   - Modified validation schema to require safety fields
   - Added fallback values using parent information when not provided

2. Added API endpoint to handle safety information updates:
   - Created `/api/parent/safety-info` endpoint
   - Option to update all current bookings with new information
   - Validation to ensure required fields are provided

## Testing

The changes have been tested to ensure:
1. Safety fields are never null in new bookings
2. Parents can update safety information through the parent portal
3. Current bookings can be updated when requested by the parent

## Next Steps

Monitor the application for any issues related to the safety field validation and parent portal functionality.
