# Focus Areas Two-Step Selection Enhancement

This update implements the following enhancements to the Focus Areas selection process:

## New Features

1. **Two-Step Focus Area Selection**
   - First select an apparatus (e.g., Tumbling, Beam, Bars, Vault)
   - Then select specific skills for that apparatus

2. **Custom Focus Areas Support**
   - Added `focus_area_other` column to the `bookings` table
   - Users can enter custom focus areas not in the predefined list
   - Custom entries are stored in the format "Other: [custom text]" in the focus areas array

## Technical Changes

1. **Database Schema**
   - Added `focus_area_other` TEXT column to the `bookings` table
   - Added trigger to sync custom focus areas with the array

2. **Frontend Components**
   - Updated FocusAreasStep component for two-step selection
   - Added UI for custom focus area input

3. **API Endpoints**
   - Updated booking creation and update endpoints to handle the new field
   - Added logic to maintain format consistency with "Other: [text]" prefix

## Deployment Instructions

1. Run the SQL migration file:
   ```bash
   psql -U <username> -d <database> -f focus_area_other_migration.sql
   ```

2. Deploy the updated code with the new component implementation
   
3. Test both new booking creation and editing with focus areas

## Schema Details

The `focus_area_other` field works in conjunction with the existing `focus_areas` array:
- When a custom focus area is provided, it's stored in `focus_area_other`
- The same text is added to the `focus_areas` array with the prefix "Other:"
- Database trigger maintains this relationship automatically

## UI Flow

1. User selects an apparatus category (e.g., "Tumbling")
2. User selects specific skills or adds custom skills
3. Selected skills are displayed with apparatus prefix (e.g., "Tumbling: Forward Roll")
4. Custom skills are displayed with "Other:" prefix (e.g., "Other: Roundoff Tuck Connection")
