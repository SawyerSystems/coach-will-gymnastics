# Booking Status System Update

## Summary
We've simplified the booking status system to use only 6 standardized values and made the status a derived value instead of a manually selectable field. This improves data consistency and reliability.

## New Booking Status Values
1. `pending` - Default initial state
2. `paid` - Payment received but not yet confirmed
3. `confirmed` - Booking is confirmed and ready
4. `completed` - Session has been completed
5. `cancelled` - Booking was cancelled
6. `failed` - Payment failure or other issue

## Code Changes

### Schema Update
1. Modified `BookingStatusEnum` in `shared/schema.ts` to only include the 6 allowed values
2. Updated the Drizzle ORM schema definition to match

### Frontend Changes
1. Created utility function `determineBookingStatus` in `client/src/lib/booking-status.ts` to derive status
2. Developed `BookingStatusBadge` component for read-only status display
3. Modified `BookingEditModal.tsx` to use derived status instead of manual selection
4. Added "Developer Mode" toggle for advanced users to override derived status

### Backend Changes
1. Created server-side utility in `server/utils/booking-status.js` for consistent status derivation
2. Updated API endpoints to enforce derived status calculation
3. Added developer mode flag to allow authorized overrides

## Database Migration
A SQL script has been created to update the database schema in Supabase:
- `update-booking-status-enum.sql` safely updates the enum type
- Handles default constraints properly
- Ensures backward compatibility with existing data

## Implementation Guide
1. Run the SQL migration script in the Supabase SQL editor
2. Deploy the code changes
3. Test with different payment and attendance status combinations
4. Verify that the booking status is correctly derived

## Benefits
- Improved data consistency
- Simplified business logic
- Reduced risk of human error
- Consistent status display across the application
