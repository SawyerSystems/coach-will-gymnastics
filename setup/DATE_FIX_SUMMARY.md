# Date Formatting Fix Summary

## Problem

There was an issue where dates displayed in the booking flow were showing one day ahead of the selected date. This was caused by timezone handling problems in JavaScript's Date object.

## Root Cause

The issue was in how date strings were being parsed into JavaScript Date objects. When a date string like `"2023-10-15"` is converted to a Date object using `new Date(dateString)`, JavaScript assumes the date is in UTC timezone (midnight UTC). 

If the user's local timezone is behind UTC (e.g., America/New_York which is UTC-4 or UTC-5), the displayed date can shift backward by one day when formatted locally.

## Solution

1. Created consistent date handling utilities in `dateUtils.ts`:
   - Added `parseDate` function to safely parse date strings with timezone handling
   - Added `formatBookingDate` function for consistent date formatting in the booking flow

2. Updated components to use these utilities:
   - `PaymentStep.tsx`
   - `ScheduleStep.tsx`
   - `AdminPaymentStep.tsx`
   - And other components that display dates

3. Fixed date parsing by ensuring a consistent approach:
   - Using `T12:00:00Z` when parsing date strings (setting time to noon UTC)
   - This ensures the date will display correctly regardless of the user's timezone

## Files Modified

## Best Practices Implemented

1. Created centralized date handling utilities to ensure consistency
2. Used UTC noon (T12:00:00Z) when parsing date strings to avoid timezone edge cases
3. Reduced duplication by using common utility functions
4. Added comments explaining the date handling approach
