Address the following critical issues impacting the CoachWillTumbles.com platform, specifically focusing on the parent portal and admin dashboard functionalities, which have surfaced post-migration to Supabase. Conduct a comprehensive review of the codebase to ensure data consistency, API integrations, and webhook implementations are functioning correctly. The primary goal is to restore the expected behavior of the booking and athlete management systems. 1. **Athlete Display Issues:** * **Parent Dashboard:** Investigate why no athletes are displayed in the 'Athletes' tab, despite a booking appearing in the 'Upcoming' tab. This discrepancy suggests a problem with data retrieval or association between bookings and athlete profiles. * **Admin Dashboard:** Replicate the investigation to determine if the same athlete display issue exists within the admin dashboard's 'Athletes' tab. 2. **Booking Creation Failure:** * **Parent Portal:** Diagnose the reason why no athletes are listed when attempting to book a new session from the parent dashboard. This likely indicates a failure in fetching or displaying athlete data during the booking process. 3. **Missing Booking in Upcoming Tab:** * **Alfred's Booking:** Analyze why Alfred's booking scheduled for July 7th is not visible in the 'Upcoming' tab. This could be due to incorrect date filtering, data corruption, or a failure in the booking status update process. 4. **Supabase Migration Impact:** * **Error Analysis:** Thoroughly examine the codebase for any communication or API errors that emerged after the migration to Supabase. Identify the root causes of these errors, which may include incorrect database queries, authentication issues, or data schema mismatches. 5. **Payment Status Synchronization:** * **Stripe Integration:** Verify that the successful payment for Alfred's booking, confirmed via the Stripe API, is accurately reflected in the system. Ensure the booking status is correctly updated to 'Paid' or a similar status, and that the payment information is consistently synchronized across the database and user interfaces. 6. **Booking Success Page:** * **Blank Page:** Investigate the blank booking success page. This could be due to a routing issue, data not being passed correctly, or an error in the component rendering the page. **Technical Requirements:** * **Codebase Review:** Conduct a detailed review of all relevant files, including those related to data fetching, database interactions (Supabase), API calls (Stripe), and user interface components. * **Data Consistency:** Ensure that all data operations, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) operations, are consistent across the platform. Verify that data is correctly formatted and validated. * **API Integration:** Validate the correct implementation of all API integrations, including Stripe for payment processing and Supabase for database operations. Confirm that API calls are made with the correct parameters and that responses are handled appropriately. * **Webhook Implementation:** Verify that webhooks are correctly configured and functioning as expected. Ensure that webhooks are triggered by relevant events and that they update the system with the correct data. * **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling throughout the codebase to catch and handle any potential errors. Log errors for debugging purposes and provide informative error messages to users. * **Testing:** Implement unit and integration tests to ensure that all functionalities are working as expected. Test the athlete display, booking creation, payment processing, and booking status update functionalities. **Expected Outcome:** The goal is to identify and resolve all the issues, ensuring that the CoachWillTumbles.com platform functions correctly and provides a seamless user experience. The solution should include a detailed analysis of the root causes of the issues, as well as a plan for fixing them. The codebase should be updated to reflect the fixes, and all functionalities should be tested to ensure that they are working as expected.
