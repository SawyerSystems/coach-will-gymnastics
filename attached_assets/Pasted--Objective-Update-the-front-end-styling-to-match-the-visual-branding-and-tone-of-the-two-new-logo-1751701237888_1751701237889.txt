üé® Objective:
Update the front-end styling to match the visual branding and tone of the two new logos provided ‚Äî one horizontal text-based and one circular emblem featuring a gymnast in motion, wings, and lightning bolts.
üîß Instructions:
Global Theme Update:
Use a bold and energetic color scheme:
Gold: #D4B400
Deep Navy: #0A0A61
Bright Red: #E60000
Black as outline or shadow when needed for pop.
Set these as CSS variables in the root of the project and apply them across all relevant elements.
Typography & Font Weights:
Use a strong, athletic sans-serif font (like Bebas Neue, Oswald, or Anton).
All headings (h1-h3) should be uppercase, bold, and spaced like a coach‚Äôs chant.
Add drop shadows or outlines subtly to key text (especially titles and buttons) using the navy or black for depth.
Logo Integration:
Replace the current header text/logo with the new horizontal logo (CoachWillTumblesText.png).
For footers, modals, and special sections (e.g. confirmation screens), use the circular emblem (CWT_Circle_LogoSPIN.png).
Make sure logos are responsive and retina-optimized.
Button Styles:
Buttons should feel like "action triggers" ‚Äî rounded rectangle, bold color fill (red or gold), and hover effects (slight bounce or glow).
Use iconography if appropriate (lightning bolt for action, wings for explore, etc.).
Backgrounds & Layout:
Keep background mostly white or dark navy for contrast.
Use angled stripes, shadows, or split backgrounds (like the circular logo's layout) to add energy.
Animate in key elements (like titles or call-to-action buttons) with a slight bounce-in or scale-up effect to match the tumbling vibe.
Section Borders & Dividers:
Use gold thin borders with subtle shadowing for high-end finish.
You can also use red/blue alternating sections to organize content visually.
Extra Vibe Enhancements:
Add animated lightning bolt SVGs as subtle accents in key areas.
Integrate winged-foot or dumbbell icons from the emblem into section headers or action cards.
Final Touch:
Make sure the overall site feels like a super-powered training journey, blending playful energy with high professionalism.
Quality Control Reminder:
‚ö†Ô∏è Fully test the site for responsiveness and visual balance on both mobile and desktop.
‚úÖ Ensure all interactive elements are still fully functional and legible.
