Address the discrepancies in athlete and booking data within the CoachWillTumbles.com platform, specifically focusing on the 'Athletes' and 'Bookings' tabs, and the athlete info modal within the admin interface. The primary goal is to ensure data consistency across all related components, particularly concerning athlete information, dates of birth (DOB), waiver statuses, and attendance records. 1. **Athlete DOB Display:** * Investigate and rectify the incorrect DOB display for athletes within the 'Athletes' tab. Ensure that the DOB displayed in the athlete card accurately reflects the athlete's actual date of birth as stored in the database. 2. **Waiver Status Synchronization:** * Analyze the waiver status logic to resolve the conflicting information regarding signed waivers. Specifically, address the scenario where a waiver is correctly marked as signed in the 'Bookings' tab but incorrectly flagged as missing in the 'Missing Waivers' section. * Verify the database interactions related to waiver status updates to ensure that the correct status is saved and reflected across all relevant views. * Consider the booking process, particularly the parent-initiated waiver completion, to ensure that the system accurately reflects the waiver status based on the booking flow. 3. **Attendance Status Consistency:** * Examine the attendance status discrepancies between the 'Bookings' tab and the athlete info modal within the admin interface. If the 'Bookings' tab indicates a 'Confirmed' attendance status, the athlete info modal should reflect the same status. * Identify the source of the inconsistency and implement a solution to ensure that attendance statuses are synchronized and consistent across all relevant components. 4. **Data Integrity and Synchronization:** * Implement measures to ensure that all athlete and booking-related data, including DOB, waiver status, and attendance, is consistently displayed across all relevant cards, modals, and instances within the platform. * Prioritize data integrity to prevent conflicting information and ensure a unified view of athlete and booking data. 5. **Specific Athlete Focus:** * Use Alfred as a test case to verify the fixes. Ensure that all data related to Alfred, including DOB, waiver status, and attendance, is accurately displayed across all relevant sections of the platform. 6. **Root Cause Analysis:** * Conduct a thorough root cause analysis to identify the underlying issues contributing to the data inconsistencies. This may involve examining database queries, data processing logic, and user interface interactions. 7. **Solution Implementation:** * Implement the necessary code changes and database updates to resolve the identified issues and ensure data consistency. 8. **Testing and Validation:** * Thoroughly test the implemented solutions to verify that the data inconsistencies have been resolved and that all athlete and booking data is accurately displayed across the platform. 9. **Documentation:** * Document the implemented solutions and any relevant code changes to facilitate future maintenance and updates. 10. **User Experience:** * Ensure that the fixes enhance the user experience by providing accurate and consistent information across the platform, reducing confusion and improving data reliability.
