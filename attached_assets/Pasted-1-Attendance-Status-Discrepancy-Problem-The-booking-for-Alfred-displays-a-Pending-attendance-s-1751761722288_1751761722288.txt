1. Attendance Status Discrepancy:  Problem: The booking for Alfred displays a 'Pending' attendance status, while the admin dashboard indicates a 'Confirmed' status. This inconsistency also appears in the parent portal.  Action: Identify the root cause of this synchronization error. Ensure that the attendance status accurately reflects the confirmed status across all user interfaces, including the admin dashboard and the parent portal.
 2. Date Discrepancy in Parent Portal:  Problem: The parent portal incorrectly displays the appointment date as July 6th, while the actual booking is scheduled for July 7th.  Action: Correct the date displayed in the parent portal to accurately reflect the scheduled booking date of July 7th. 
3. Waiver Button and Modal Update:  Action: Update the 'Create Waiver' button in the parent dashboard to read 'Sign Waiver'.  Action: Ensure the waiver signing process within the modal mirrors the same user experience as the booking process. 
4. Payment Status Synchronization:  Problem: Despite claims of synchronization with the Stripe payment system, the 'Reservation Paid' status in the bookings tab reverts to hardcoded values instead of dynamically updating based on Stripe webhooks.  Action: Verify and correct the integration with Stripe to ensure the 'Reservation Paid' status accurately reflects the payment status received from Stripe webhooks. The status should dynamically update based on the actual payment information. Ensure that all fixes maintain data integrity and provide a consistent user experience across all platform interfaces.
5. Incorporate a 'Gender' field into the athlete profiles within the CoachWillTumbles.com platform. This field should be integrated across all booking processes, including new parent registrations, logged-in parent bookings, and manual admin entries. Update the athlete information modals and cards to display the newly added 'Gender' field, ensuring it is clearly visible and easily accessible within the user interface. The implementation should maintain the existing design and functionality of the platform while seamlessly integrating the new field.
