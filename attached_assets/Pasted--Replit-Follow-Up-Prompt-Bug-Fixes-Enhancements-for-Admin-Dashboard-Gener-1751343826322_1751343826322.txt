## 🔁 **Replit Follow-Up Prompt: Bug Fixes + Enhancements for Admin Dashboard**

---

### 🔧 **General Booking Tab**

1. **🗓 Add Calendar Picker** by the "Booking Management" title for quick date-based filtering.
2. **⚠️ Fix Manual Booking Flow:**

   * Focus Area selection must follow this logic:

     * Step 1: Select Apparatus (e.g., Tumbling)
     * Step 2: Show related Skill options based on apparatus

---

### 📆 **Upcoming Sessions Tab**

1. **🗓 Add Calendar Picker** near title for fast search by session date.
2. Default to sorting by earliest upcoming sessions; allow toggle between ascending/descending.

### 🧒🏼 **Athletes Tab**

1. **📸 Fix Photo Enlargement**: Clicking image thumbnail should open a modal with a full-size view.
2. **📝 Athlete Edit Form**: Edit button is missing — restore it and connect it to the form modal.
3. **❌ Deletion Error Handling**:

   * If athlete has active bookings, show a **clear modal popup**:

     * Title: `Cannot delete athlete`
     * Description: Explain why (e.g., 2 active bookings)
     * List booking dates/types
     * Suggest: "Cancel these sessions before deleting"
   * Do **not** rely on raw API error messages in the frontend.

### 📚 **Content Tab (Blogs, Tips, Drills)**

1. **🖋 Fix Edit Buttons**: Blog and Tips post edit buttons currently do nothing — wire them to open existing post in edit mode.
2. **➕ Add Section-Based Editor**:

   * Each post supports multiple sections.
   * After each section, allow:

     * 📷 Photo upload (PNG, JPG)
     * 🎥 Video upload or URL (YouTube, Vimeo)
3. Store post data as structured JSON array of sections:

   ```json
   [
     {
       "text": "Intro content here...",
       "image": "/uploads/intro.png",
       "videoUrl": null
     },
     {
       "text": "Drill technique tips...",
       "image": null,
       "videoUrl": "https://youtube.com/embed/xyz"
     }
   ]
   ```

### 🗓 **Schedule Tab**

1. **🗂 Archive Expired Blocked Times**:

   * Once the date passes, hide from main view.
   * Create a “View Previous Blocked Times” button.
2. **📝 Edit Blocked Times**:

   * Allow admin to update a time block (e.g., change 3–5 PM to 4–6 PM).
3. **🐛 Date Bug**:

   * When adding a blocked date (e.g., 7/9/2025), the system submits it as 7/8/2025 — fix timezone or UTC/local issue.

---

### 💰 **Payments Tab**

1. Clarify Stripe Integration:

   * **Am I able to run Stripe commands (refund, cancel)** directly on the site?
   * Or is this view-only, and actions must be done via redirect to Stripe dashboard?
2. If **Stripe commands are possible**, build:

   * Refund button
   * Payment status update
   * Webhook listening for status changes

---

### 📊 **Analytics Tab**

1. **🧭 Add Time-Based Filters**:

   * Filter by:

     * Day
     * Week
     * Month
     * Year
   * Allow selection of custom ranges (e.g., select a single day, week range, or specific month/year)
2. **📅 Date Picker UI**:

   * Add UI controls for selecting day/week/month ranges

---

### ✅ Final Notes:

* Maintain responsive UI on all screens.
* Ensure all modals include cancel/close actions.
* Apply consistent error feedback (toast or inline) for every failed action.
* Keep all admin functions behind session auth.
