💡 Updated FAQ Section

Swap current FAQ with this upgraded, parent-first version:

⸻

Q1. What age should my child start gymnastics?
A: Most kids are ready by age 4 or 5 — especially if they’re constantly moving, flipping off the couch, or can’t sit still. We adapt to each child’s pace.

⸻

Q2. What should they wear?
A: Leotards or fitted activewear works best. No skirts, baggy clothes, or zippers. Hair up, no jewelry — just comfort and focus.

⸻

Q3. Do I need to bring anything?
A: Nope — we provide all the mats, equipment, and safety gear. Just bring a water bottle and good energy.

⸻

Q4. Can I stay and watch?
A: Absolutely. We have a designated viewing area in the lobby where parents can comfortably watch and cheer from a distance.

⸻

Q5. What if my child has special needs or support requirements?
A: Coach Will has experience working with kids with autism, ADHD, anxiety, and other challenges. Just let us know in advance — every child deserves a path to thrive.

⸻

Q6. What’s the difference between private and semi-private lessons?
A: Private lessons are one-on-one. Semi-private means two athletes sharing the session — still focused, but more social. Both are customized to the child’s goals.

⸻

Q7. What happens if we can’t make it?
A: Life happens — I get it! Please try to give at least 24 hours’ notice so we can adjust the schedule and offer the spot to another family.

⸻

Q8. Is this just for fun, or can it get competitive?
A: Both! Whether your child wants to flip for fun or has big competition goals, Coach Will builds strong foundations, one step at a time.
