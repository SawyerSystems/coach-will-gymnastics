Booking
Objective: Rewrite the Booking page to avoid transactional language and build a sense of long-term partnership and trust with parents.
Emphasize growth, adventure, and coaching—not prices or reservations.
Incorporate “Side Quests” (flexibility, strength, agility, breathing, mental blocks) as optional lesson focuses.
Remove phrases like “Book Now,” “Price,” or “Reservation.”
Replace with journey-based, adventure-themed wording.
Keep lesson types, layout, and pricing logic intact.
Remove “booking terms” and hard rules from front end—those will be included post-payment or emailed after form submission.
