## Testing Email Functionality

We've created a comprehensive test script (`test-email-functionality.js`) that verifies all critical email sending functions. This script:

1. Tests Session Confirmation Email
2. Tests Reschedule Confirmation Email (this was the one that was fixed)
3. Tests Waiver Reminder Email
4. Tests Session Reminder Email
5. Tests Birthday Email
6. Tests Reservation Payment Link Email

### Running the Email Test Suite

```bash
# Make sure the development server is running first
node test-email-functionality.js
```

The script will:
1. Login as an admin to get proper authentication
2. Test each email type and report success/failure
3. Provide a summary of results

### Manual Testing of Individual Emails

If you need to test a specific email type manually, you can use these methods:

#### Session Confirmation
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/test-email-thomas -H "Cookie: YOUR_ADMIN_COOKIE"
```

#### Reschedule Confirmation
```bash
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:5001/api/bookings/127 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: YOUR_ADMIN_COOKIE" \
  -d '{"preferredDate":"2025-10-20","preferredTime":"17:00:00"}'
```

#### Session Reminder (Trigger the cron job)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/admin/trigger-session-reminders \
  -H "Cookie: YOUR_ADMIN_COOKIE"
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Missing Parent Email

**Problem:** Email sending fails because parent email can't be found.

**Solution:** 
- Always handle null/undefined `parentId` values with conditional checks
- Verify parent email exists before attempting to send
- Add proper logging to debug email sending issues

```typescript
// Correct pattern for sending emails with parent data
const parentData = bookingData.parentId ? await storage.getParentById(bookingData.parentId) : null;
if (parentData?.email) {
  await sendEmailFunction(parentData.email, otherParams);
} else {
  console.log(`No parent email found for parentId: ${bookingData.parentId}`);
}
```

### 2. Wrong Method Name

**Problem:** Using incorrect method names like `getParent` instead of `getParentById`.

**Solution:** 
- Always use TypeScript to catch these errors
- Run `npm run check` to validate types before testing
- Use code completion in your IDE to prevent mistakes

### 3. Email Template Issues

**Problem:** Email templates have missing or incorrectly formatted variables.

**Solution:**
- Test templates with sample data
- Use React Email's preview feature to check formatting
- Verify that all required data is passed to templates

## Monitoring Email Deliveries

For production, you can monitor email deliveries through the Resend dashboard. Key metrics to watch:

- Delivery rate (should be >99%)
- Open rate 
- Bounce rate (should be <1%)
- Complaints

## Recent Fix: Reschedule Email

We recently fixed an issue where reschedule confirmation emails weren't being sent. The problem was:

1. Using incorrect method name `getParent` instead of `getParentById`
2. Not handling the case where `parentId` could be null

The fix applied was:

```typescript
// Before (with bug):
const parentData = await storage.getParent(updatedBooking.parentId);

// After (fixed):
const parentData = updatedBooking.parentId ? await storage.getParentById(updatedBooking.parentId) : null;
```

This fix ensures all reschedule emails now send correctly.
