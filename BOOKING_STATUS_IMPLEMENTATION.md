# Booking Status System Implementation

## Summary
We have successfully implemented a streamlined booking status system that derives the booking status automatically from payment and attendance status. The system now uses only six standardized status values, improving data consistency and reliability.

## Key Changes

### 1. Schema Updates
- Modified `BookingStatusEnum` in `shared/schema.ts` to include only the 6 allowed values:
  - `pending`: Default initial state
  - `paid`: Payment received but not yet confirmed
  - `confirmed`: Booking is confirmed and ready
  - `completed`: Session has been completed
  - `cancelled`: Booking was cancelled
  - `failed`: Payment failure or other issue

### 2. Frontend Implementation
- Created `determineBookingStatus` utility in `client/src/lib/booking-status.ts` to automatically derive booking status
- Implemented `BookingStatusBadge` component for clear visual indication of status
- Updated `BookingEditModal.tsx` to display derived status instead of allowing manual selection
- Added "Developer Mode" toggle for advanced administrators to override derived status

### 3. Backend Implementation
- Created `server/utils/booking-status.js` with server-side status derivation logic
- Updated API endpoints to enforce derived status calculation
- Added developer mode flag to control when manual status changes are allowed

### 4. Data Migration
- Created SQL script (`booking-status-migration.sql`) to update the database:
  - Mapped legacy status values to new standardized values
  - Updated the enum type to only allow the six standardized values
  - Handled default constraints properly
  - Added verification queries to ensure data integrity

### 5. Transition Logic
- `no-show` attendance status now maps to `completed` booking status
- `manual` attendance status now maps to either `pending` or `confirmed` based on payment status
- Legacy statuses handled in UI with appropriate colors and descriptions

## Testing Results
We ran comprehensive tests to verify that all status combinations produce the expected derived booking status:
- All 9 test cases pass successfully
- Status derivation logic is consistent between client and server
- TypeScript errors have been resolved

## Implementation Plan
1. Review changes in this pull request
2. Run the SQL migration script in the Supabase SQL Editor
3. Deploy code changes
4. Verify functionality in the production environment

## Benefits
- Improved data consistency across the application
- Simplified business logic for status management
- Reduced risk of human error through automation
- Clear visual indicators of booking status
- Developer mode for exceptional cases
