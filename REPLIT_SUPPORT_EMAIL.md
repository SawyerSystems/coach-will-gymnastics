# Replit Support Request: Supabase Integration Issues

**Subject:** Critical Supabase Integration Issue - Database Connection Established But Queries Failing

**Priority:** High

---

## Project Overview

**Repl Name:** CoachWillTumbles.com  
**Project Type:** Full-stack JavaScript application (React + Express + PostgreSQL)  
**Issue Category:** Database Integration / Supabase Connectivity  
**Date:** July 4, 2025  

## Problem Summary

We have a complete gymnastics coaching platform that was successfully migrated from Neon to Supabase. However, the DATABASE_URL environment variable contains an incorrect hostname that cannot be resolved, causing all database queries to fail with DNS resolution errors.

**CRITICAL FINDING:** The hostname `db.nwdgtdzrcyfmislilucy.supabase.co` in the DATABASE_URL environment variable is returning `ENOTFOUND` errors, indicating it doesn't exist or is incorrectly formatted.

## Technical Details

### Environment Configuration
- **Database Provider:** Supabase PostgreSQL
- **ORM:** Drizzle ORM with postgres-js driver
- **Backend:** Express.js with TypeScript
- **Frontend:** React with TypeScript
- **Environment Variables:** SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, DATABASE_URL (all configured)

### Current Status
‚úÖ **Working:**
- Supabase client initialization successful
- Direct postgres connection established 
- Express server running on port 5000
- Frontend loads correctly
- Stripe API integration functional

‚ùå **Failing:**
- All database queries return 500 errors
- Blog posts API: `{"message":"Failed to fetch blog posts"}`
- Tips API: `{"message":"Failed to fetch tips"}`
- Booking operations cannot persist data

### Connection Logs

## Database Migration Status

### Migration Script Executed
- **File:** `supabase-setup.sql` (comprehensive 500+ line migration)
- **Status:** "All tables were created and data migrated to supabase successfully"
- **Data Preserved:** 
  - 6 parent/customer records
  - 1 athlete with base64 photo
  - 2 complete bookings
  - 6 availability time slots
  - 4 schedule exceptions
  - 1 admin account
  - Authentication codes
  - Sample blog posts and tips

### Schema Structure
12+ interconnected tables including:
- `parents` (customer data)
- `athletes` (with photo support)
- `bookings` (lesson scheduling)
- `blog_posts` (content management)
- `tips` (gymnastics guidance)
- `availability` (scheduling)
- `availability_exceptions` (blocked dates)
- `admins` (authentication)
- `auth_codes` (parent verification)
- `waivers` (legal documents)

## Configuration Files

### Supabase Client (`server/supabase-client.ts`)
```typescript
export const supabase = createClient(
  process.env.SUPABASE_URL,
  process.env.SUPABASE_ANON_KEY,
  {
    auth: {
      autoRefreshToken: false,
      persistSession: false
    }
  }
);

// Drizzle ORM configuration
pgClient = postgres(process.env.DATABASE_URL, {
  max: 10,
  idle_timeout: 20,
  connect_timeout: 10,
  ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false },
  prepare: false
});
drizzleDb = drizzle(pgClient, { schema });
```

### Database URL Format
Using official Supabase connection string format with transaction pooler.

## Specific Questions for Replit Support

1. **Environment Variables:** Are SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_ANON_KEY properly configured in the Replit secrets?

2. **Database Permissions:** Could this be a Row Level Security (RLS) issue in Supabase? Should we disable RLS for server-side operations?

3. **Connection Pooling:** Are there any Replit-specific considerations for postgres connection pooling with Supabase?

4. **SSL Configuration:** Is the SSL configuration (`ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false }`) appropriate for Replit's environment?

5. **Query Debugging:** How can we enable detailed query logging to identify where the 500 errors are originating?

## Reproduction Steps

1. Visit the application URL (running on port 5000)
2. Navigate to /blog or /tips pages
3. Observe 500 errors in network tab
4. Check server logs for database query failures

## Expected Behavior

After successful database migration, all API endpoints should:
- Return data from Supabase tables
- Allow booking creation and management
- Enable admin authentication
- Display blog posts and tips content

## Current Workaround

None available - this is a blocking issue preventing the application from functioning.

## Additional Context

This is a production coaching platform serving real customers. We have successfully migrated the complete dataset and the application was previously working with Neon database. The migration to Supabase appears successful from a data perspective, but the application cannot query the data.

## Request for Assistance

We need help identifying why database queries are failing despite successful connection establishment. This could be:
- Environment configuration issue
- Supabase permissions problem
- Connection string format issue
- Replit-specific networking consideration
